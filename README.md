CPM in project management, C# .NET application

I want to mention couple of things:

First of all this application was the main scope to work exactly like CPM calculation on paper, itwas not important the design.
Second thing, the code is orientated to be for Romania so there are a lot of words in romanian.
Third thing, a requirment from that was to not use a lot of OOP principles or strctures in code, so all calculation was tried to be done in data manipulation from a single class.
